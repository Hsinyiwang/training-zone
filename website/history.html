        Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. 
      </li>
      <li>
          Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). 
      </li>
      <li>
          Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. 
      </li>
      <li>
          Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: 
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Which one are you most on top of? 
            </li>
            <li>
                Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? 
            </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.
      </li>
    </ul>
